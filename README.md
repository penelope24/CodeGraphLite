# CodeGraphLite
**CodeGraphLite** is a machine learning oriented framework to build common code graph structures including PDG (Program Dependency Graph), CFG (Control Flow Graph) and CDG (Code Dependency Graph) from pure source code. Since this framework does not need compilation, it avoids the heavvy time and labor cost associated with traditional construction tools such as **Soot** or **Spoon**. To this end, this framkework is suitable for building massive code graphs corpus for training machine learning models.

**CodeGraphLite** 是一个面向机器学习的轻量级代码图结构构建平台，它支持从源码构建常见的代码图结构，例如PDG，CFG，CDG等等。这种方法不需要通过编译，避免了传统构建工具（如**Soot**或**Sppon**）所带来的巨大时间和人工成本，适合为机器学习模型构建大批量的代码图结构训练数据。
